Next steps
===============

Now that you have a basic Squadron setup going, it's time to make it do more
for you.

If you want to follow along with this guide, we've made a git repo for you so
you don't have to type out all these commands.

Just do this and you'll be at the start of the next steps guide (which is the
end of the getting started guide)::

    $ git clone -b simple https://github.com/gosquadron/example-squadron-repo.git

The end result of this page is in the nextsteps branch of the same repo.
